# Django Rest Framework: Beginning the Learning Journey

Hello :)

This repository marks the beginning of my learning journey with the Django Rest Framework (DRF). Here, you'll find examples, experiments, and notes related to the main features and best practices of this powerful tool for building APIs in Django.

## Goals
- Explore the fundamental features of DRF.
- Develop simple APIs to solidify learning.
- Document lessons learned throughout the process. 

## Content
- Code examples.
- Explanatory notes and comments.
- Useful links for documentation and references.

### Explanatory Notes and Comments
Below is a list of commands used during the course, organized by chapter:

On Mac, in the bash_profile file, add this line at the end: alias python=python3 to create an alias.
Then, run the command source ~/.bash_profile to update the shell with the latest changes.
